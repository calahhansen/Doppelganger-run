# How to contribute alongside of the The Titans Team:
## Did you find a bug?
Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?
Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

## Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?
Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability will generally not be accepted.

## Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?
Suggest your change by opening a new issue on GitHub. We ❤️ new ideas for future features!

Be sure to include a title such as AMAZING IDEA and a clear description, with as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating that you can blow our minds!

## Do you want to contribute to the documentation?
This group project is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and connect with us!

Thanks!
